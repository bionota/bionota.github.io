The age-old question - first asked by Plato in 361 B.C., and again by Thomas Aquinus, Hegel, Bertrand Russel, Isaac Newton, Tesla, Darwin and dozens of other great thinkers:

"Do Geese feed fish, and if so why?"

The goal of BRICS is total independence from the USD and U.S. financial instruments and institutions.

My tweet about flying across the U.S. border at 5 feet above the ground next week elicited:

"How can you cross the wall at 5 feet above the ground?".

What wall???

Only 3 miles were built out of 1,973 miles of border!!

Most Chinese bird experiments are flawed.

Using hawks to disarm criminals has resulted in innocents being shot, and using  crows to deliver emergency medications has resulted in address fuck-ups.

The only successful experiments were using birds to block surveillance cameras.

Why?

My reasons.

Maybe I stashed $800 million in South American Emeralds and South African unpolished Diamonds in the desert.

Maybe I'm picking someone up.

Maybe I have a message that must be delivered "Mouth to ear".

Maybe it has to do with the widow's son.

My reasons.

Jun 9th - Robert Fuller, a black man, found hanging from a tree in Palmdale, CA.

One week earlier Malcolm Harsch, another black man, found hanging from a tree in Victorville - 40 miles away.

Both ruled a suicide.

I had to research local newspapers to discover this.

Travis Yates of the Tulsa P.D. said:

We take chances with each choice we make - who to marry, where to live.

With each decision we're placing a bet, and understanding the odds is the key to success.

If we see the truth around us, then the odds are clear.

What are the odds teenage love will last?

MDPV, a-php, C2-E, etc. Have replaced them.

Was asked if I could be a podcast guest and not cuss.

My reply:

Even if it were possible -- I might not agree to it,

But being that it is not ...

I must decline.

Engineering is the basis of technological growth,

And software engineering is the foundation for all other engineering disciplines.

Every discipline depends on the functions, formulas, constructs,  projections and simulations created by software engineers.

Coder geeks rule!

Is there hope, they ask?

Hope for what?

A better life?
More drugs?
Less taxes?
More self awareness?
A Government that cares?
Lower taxes?
Better jobs?
More sex?
A loving God?
Someone who is interested in US?
Forgiveness?

I only know this:

There is hope for one of the above.

There is a difference between knowing the Truth and speaking the Truth.

The first is a great advantage.

The second is a grave danger.

=======
Wed May 20 15:52:49 +0000 2020
Why don't we all tell the truth?

Honesty, sadly, is not supportive of evolution.

Look at flowers that mimic insects to aid pollination.

Leopards that look like fields of weeds.

Fish that have appendages that look like lures.

Truth is in not life supporting.

Deception is.

Claiming a procuct is open source while witholding the documention is fraud. Pure and simple. I will soon demonstrate that in the courts.

My final tweet in the $GHOST controversy:

PIVX is attempting to claim that their source code is Public Domain, but that the description of how it all works (The White Paper) is not!

Then what f*cking good is Open Source if the documentation is not included?

What scam is this?

Crypto growth frequently is based on forking blockchains.

PIVX is open source - no one owns it.

We took the PIVX blockchain and forked it to create $GHOST.

We changed much, but why re-write those functions of the blockchain which we did not change?

How can that be plagiarism?

=======

The $GHOST controversy is storm in a teacup.

Forking an existing blockchain is a common occurrence, ex: Bitcoin to BTC, etc.

The developers of the original blockchain always kick up a fuss. It's the way of the world.

This is a triviality folks. Get over it.

The US believes I have hidden crypto. I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association. 

I have nothing. 

Yet, I regret nothing.
